# bioinformatics_pipelines_study

Bioinformatics pipelines are essential for processing large-scale biological data in genomics, transcriptomics, and metagenomics. However, developers and users frequently encounter obstacles in pipeline development and maintenance. To understand the practical challenges faced in real-world bioinformatics pipelines, we conducted an empirical study using posts from Biostars, GitHub repoistories, and real-world Github issues.
Through coding of 1,000 Biostars posts, we built a taxonomy of pipeline challenges discussed by the users. 
Our analysis of 22 mature pipeline repositories revealed common design patterns, features in pipeline implementation.
We  analyzed 1,000 developer-reported issues
from these repositories to build a taxonomy for the pipeline maintenance difficulties.
We also benchmarked large language models on pipeline-related tasks to assess their effectiveness in supporting pipeline development and debugging. 
From these analyses, we distilled some key lessons to guide further research and actions in aiding developers with bioinformatics pipeline development.

This study provides a structured investigation into bioinformatics pipeline challenges by integrating user discussions, real-world code analysis,  developer-reported issues and empiricial evaluation with LLMs. The key contributions of this work are:
     We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of bioinformatics pipeline challenges through systematic analysis of user discussions from online forums.
     We analyze real-world bioinformatics pipeline repositories to uncover key features, design patterns, and best practices in contemporary pipeline development.
     We systematically examine developer-reported issues from these repositories to identify the practical difficulties and bottlenecks developers face in real-world pipeline maintenance.
     We conduct the first empirical evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for supporting  bioinformatics pipeline development.
     We discuss actionable implications and future work for developers and distill some key lessons to guide further research.

In this study, we try to answer four research questions, including:

# 1. What aspects of pipelines are discussed by users in online forums? 

# 2. What key features and characteristics are prevalent in bioinformatics pipeline codebases? 

# 3. What are the common issues and considerations faced by developers when maintaining and improving bioinformatics pipelines? 

# 4. How well do  LLMs support the bioinformatics pipelines development?

RQ1 explores user-reported challenges and needs, RQ2 examines how these are reflected in actual pipeline implementations, RQ3 uncovers practical difficulties faced during pipeline maintenance, and RQ4 evaluates whether modern LLMs can assist in addressing these challenges. 

The corresponding codes and data are in the RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, RQ4 folders.
