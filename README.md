# bioinformatics_pipelines_study

Bioinformatics pipelines are essential for processing large-scale biological data in genomics, transcriptomics, and metagenomics. However, developers and users frequently encounter obstacles in pipeline development and maintenance. To understand the practical challenges faced in real-world bioinformatics pipelines, we conducted an empirical study using posts from Biostars, GitHub repoistories, and real-world Github issues.
Through coding of 1,000 Biostars posts, we built a taxonomy of pipeline challenges discussed by the users. 
Our analysis of 22 mature pipeline repositories revealed common design patterns, features in pipeline implementation.
We  analyzed 1,000 developer-reported issues
from these repositories to build a taxonomy for the pipeline maintenance difficulties.
We also benchmarked large language models on pipeline-related tasks to assess their effectiveness in supporting pipeline development and debugging. 
From these analyses, we distilled some key lessons to guide further research and actions in aiding developers with bioinformatics pipeline development.
